The project consists of re-analyzing, on a UCA Mesocenter computational cluster, the ATAC-seq data produced in Gomez-Cabrero et al. (2019).
Briefly, one of the goals of this study is to identify regions of the genome accessible to transcription as the DNA opens and detaches from the nucleosomal complex. For this purpose, the analysis was conducted on a mouse B3 cell line. The mouse B3 cell line models the pre-BI stage (or Hardy's fraction C'). After nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Ikaros, these cells progress to the
cells progress to the pre-BII stage (or Hardy fraction D). During the pre-BII stage (or Hardy fraction D), B cell progenitors undergo growth arrest and differentiation. The B3 cell line was retrovirally transduced with a vector encoding an Ikaros-REt2 fusion protein, which controls nuclear levels of Ikaros after exposure to the drug Tamoxifen. After drug treatment, cultures were harvested at 0 and 24 hours
harvested at 0 h and 24 h. The ATAC-seq experimental design is as follows: ~ 50,000 cells collected per sample 3 replicates per sample: Replicate 1, Replicate 2, and Replicate 3 2 cell stages: 0 and 24h

The project will consist in building a workflow for this ATAC-seq analysis.
